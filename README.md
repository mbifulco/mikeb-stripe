### Beliefs
My beliefs are always changing - but here's some things that are important to me:

- I believe in the power of critical thought, and the scientific process.
- I believe all people deserve fair and equitable access to all things. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ‚úä
- I know that my knowledge is imperfect, and I can be blind to my privilege. I'm always willing to listen.
- There is opportunity for design and technology to impact and benefit all facets of our life.
- Humor is a good thing

I'd love to hear your thoughts on my thoughts - don't be shy!
